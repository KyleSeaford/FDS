# Fire Detection System (FDS)

Welcome to the Fire Detection System (FDS) repository, a system designed for early detection and prevention of wildfires in remote and forested areas.

## Overview

The Fire Detection System (FDS) utilizes a network of sensors connected to Raspberry Pis to detect various environmental conditions such as smoke, temperature changes, and visual monitoring through cameras. These sensors continuously monitor the area for any signs of fire or smoke.

## Features

- **Sensor Network**: Utilizes a network of sensors including smoke detectors, temperature sensors, and cameras.
- **Automated Responses**: Upon detecting any changes or triggers from the sensors, the system automatically initiates responses such as email alerts, text alerts, and notifications to emergency responders.
- **Data Visualization**: The data collected from the sensor network can be viewed on a webpage created using Flask and HTML, providing real-time monitoring and visualization of environmental conditions.

## Usage

the Fire Detection System (FDS) continuously monitors the environment for any signs of wildfires. Users can access the web interface to view real-time data and receive alerts in case of any detected anomalies.
