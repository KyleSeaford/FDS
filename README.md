# Forest Defence System (FDS)
Welcome to the Forest Defence System (FDS) repository, a system designed for early detection and prevention of wildfires in remote and forested areas.

## Overview

The Forest Defence System (FDS) utilizes a network of sensors connected to Raspberry Pis to detect various environmental conditions such as smoke, temperature changes, and visual monitoring through cameras. These sensors continuously monitor the area for any signs of fire or smoke.

## Features

- **Sensor Network**: Utilizes a network of sensors including smoke detectors, temperature sensors, and cameras.
- **Solar-Powered Nodes**: Each node in the network is solar-powered, ensuring continuous operation even in remote areas without access to conventional power sources.
- **Automated Responses**: Upon detecting any changes or triggers from the sensors, the system automatically initiates responses such as email alerts, text alerts, and notifications to emergency responders.
- **Data Visualization**: The data collected from the sensor network can be viewed on a webpage created using Flask and HTML, providing real-time monitoring and visualization of environmental conditions.

## Usage

The Forest Defencen System (FDS) continuously monitors the environment for any signs of wildfires. Users can access the web interface to view real-time data and receive alerts in case of any detected anomalies.

## ToDo
- [ ] capital c on location
- [ ] help notifaction / page when button clicked (help next to settings) in help tell you how to use with link to github
- [ ] default open on zone 1
- [ ] save zones until clered
- [ ] intergrate onto pi
- [ ] make zones more intresting

## improvements 
- [ ] replace ip location with gps data
